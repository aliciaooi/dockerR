# dockerR

My docker R time machine. Builds a basic Ubuntu image with R and sets the CRAN mirror to the MRAN snapshot on a given date (set in the Dockerfile).

This is pretty new and settling down how I want to use it. So if you think you might begin relying on it I'd suggest making a fork and working from there.
